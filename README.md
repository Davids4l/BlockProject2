# BlockProject2

Overview:
This project is a simple password checker that evaluates the strength of your password for educational purposes only! It uses certain criteria to test the strength of your password such as length, use of special characters, use of combination of capital and lower case letters, etc.

Features:
- Checks password strength based these criterias:
  - Length
  - Character variety
  - Common pattern detection
  - Sequential character detection
  -  Provides corrective feedback
  -  Learn more about passwords feature
  -  Password is hidden for privacy during on collection

Prerequisites:
  - Python 3.6 or higher intalled

Dependencies:
  - This program uses Python's standard library, no additional packages are needed to run the program.

How to run:
  - Clone the repository or download the python script directly.
  - Run the script or make the python script an executable and run.
  - Follow the program's interactive menu
    - Choose option 1 to test a password
    - Choose option 2 to learn more about strong passwords
    - Choose option 3 to exit the program

LIMITATIONS AND WARNINGS:
Limited Analysis: This tool only checks basic patterns. Real password security involves many factors this tool doesn't consider:
  - Whether the password has been exposed in data breaches
  - The security of the service storing the password
  - Two-factor authentication status
  - Password manager usage

Responsible use general guideline:
  DO:
    - Use this tool to learn about what makes a password strong
    - Share it as a tool for education
    - Modify and experiment with this program to understand more about password algorithms
  DONT:
    - Enter real passwords from real accounts
    - Use this program on a public computer
    - Share passwords you tested with anyone
    - Use it to check other people's passwords

Educational Purpose Only: This tool demonstrates password strength concepts and should NOT be used for securing real accounts.

Ethical Considerations and Responsible usage:
  False sense of security: Users could think a strong rating might mean that their password is completely unpredictabe however, hackers use advanced techniques not covered within this simple password checker; Such as social engineering to obtain more information and predicting passwords with clever algorithms.
  Impersonations: Someone could take this and use it to harvest passwords from people who use this program by falsely advertising it as a legitimate resource.
